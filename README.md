### Python-API-Challenge
## Important note
* This is not the main branch because I accidently deleted My WeatherPy and VacationPy on the main branch. I tried restoring it and made a sepaerate branch called restore.

## General Informaiton
In this challenge I used API from open weatherAPI and google platform api to get request information and create dataframes with it. I started with WeatherPy and used the OpenWeatherAPI to get weather information of over 600 cities. After that I created dataframe with that and outputted a csv file. I then created 12 scatter plots to show various regression lines based on latitude and other weather conditiond such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness. I then moved to VacationPy where I took the csv I created from part 1 and add a heat map to show humidity. I then used the google platofmr API to find the nearest hotels in those cities based on a radius from latitude and longitude.

## Technologies Used
* Google Platform API
* Open Weather API
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Python
